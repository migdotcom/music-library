TRIGGER IDEAS 

When a user adds a new album, text is added to their Bio saying "New album out now!!! {AlbumName} released {albumObject.Time stamp}"

Delete: 


If a playlist has enough tracks of a certain genre, 

Do "Most common genre in playlist" 

to join: track, playlist with track_track_playlist , then track -> track.Tag_id , which gets a unique one to one tag. which then we get a singular Genre from. 

to start, get all the genres from a playlist

maybe need to work backwards? ---> no
