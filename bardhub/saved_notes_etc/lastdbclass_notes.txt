reports
	Can be data listing from a set of tables (analagous to our album view, and to our carousel feed)
	could be tracking it with charts bar graphs data display like this (we won't be)

SSRS sql server reporting services- can be linked with any dbms. it's a software that generates data reports. etc. 
	It isn't pulling data with a SELECT * , it's a restricted view. 
	She is looking for us to use aggregate functions, and minimalistic computation, and time window paramters from two dates and provide data for that time window. 

		-> So we're gonna need to have diverse release dates for the music library tracks and pull by date. T_T
		-> At least two data reports. 

questions: can we do "newest albums" and "user albums"? 
 make sure the output of our query is what is populating our report. (sql query) 
don't compute from the frontend, only backend aggregate functions. WILL BE GRADED HERE. 

go beyond the newest albums
count the number of albums released last week
we could do total play count <----------done
how many artists
how many new artists
how many new albums added in past month <------------
get the numbers not data listings.

data insertion and data modification (delete is not important)

So atleast 2 reports
 1
-Enter new data and updating existing data
-user authentication
-2 triggers
-2 reports

Project due date is 24th
