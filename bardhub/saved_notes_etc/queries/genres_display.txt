SELECT A.album_id, A.id, B.genre
FROM track_track A join tag_tag B on A.tag_id=B.id
WHERE A.id = '1'

FIXED: 
SELECT album_album.Name as "Album", A.Name as "Track", user_user.username as "Artist"
FROM track_track A join tag_tag B on A.tag_id=B.id
INNER JOIN album_album ON A.album_id = album_album.id
INNER JOIN user_user ON A.Artist_id = user_user.id
WHERE genre = "Chiptune"

Notes: 
so i have created a query to where it shows u tracks of the specific genre. I was thinking maybe have a genre tab and have user either search for a genre OR have buttons of different genre and when they click it, it shows them the tracks associated with that genre.
So as for insert, have ('1', 'Jazz'),(‘2’, ‘Rock’), (‘3’, ‘Pop’) etc.
