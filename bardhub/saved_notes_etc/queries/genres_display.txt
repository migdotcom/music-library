SELECT A.album_id, A.id, B.genre
FROM track_track A join tag_tag B on A.tag_id=B.id
WHERE A.id = '1'

FIXED: 
SELECT A.album_id, A.id AS track_id, B.genre AS genre
FROM track_track A join tag_tag B on A.tag_id=B.id
WHERE genre = pass_genre_here

Notes: 
so i have created a query to where it shows u tracks of the specific genre. I was thinking maybe have a genre tab and have user either search for a genre OR have buttons of different genre and when they click it, it shows them the tracks associated with that genre.
So as for insert, have ('1', 'Jazz'),(‘2’, ‘Rock’), (‘3’, ‘Pop’) etc.
