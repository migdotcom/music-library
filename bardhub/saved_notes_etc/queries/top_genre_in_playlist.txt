Some notes about this: It will return only the top 1 genre with its count, so if there are tied genres (Pop has 10 tracks in user's playlists and Rock has 10 tracks in user's playlists), only one of them will show. Which one, I don't know. 
Also, if a song is in multiple playlists, it will count multiple times. Which is actually good as it will more accurately reflect the user's favorite preference.
