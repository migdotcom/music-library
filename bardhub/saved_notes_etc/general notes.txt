We can just drop individual tables instead of the whole db! when making changes


need to do npm install and npm run-script, finally  npm run dev
some of the below are steps and some are actual console commands

inside music-library/bardhub you run these commands
install latest python 3.8
git clone the repository
pip install pipenv
cd into repo 
pipenv shell
pipenv install
pipenv install mysqlclient


python manage.py createsuperuser
group9
123456
to access the api for editing db

react components always named with capital letter first, even if the JS file and folder are lowercase first
example: import ArtistPage from "./ArtistPage" when the folder is artistPage and file is artistPage.js 

SQL does not support one-to-one
so instead, db tools like Django will either create mapping tables, or will make the target value unique

.get only returns 1
we are using User in place of artist for all intents and purposes
button onClick = {this.props.deleteLead.bind(this, lead.id)} className = "whatever"

use one queryset for one function



What you as a user have to install on your system: 
SQL server, command line tool, workbench, service
npm through node.js which will install vs code, python2, many other things
make sure root password matches development root password

in sql command line tool, show databases;
create database bardhub;
(our db name)
use bardhub
(no semicolon)

in project directory, python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
npm run dev

goto localhost:8000
with api endpoints such as localhost:8000/api/tracks
