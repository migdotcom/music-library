Open console/ command prompt as administrator. 
navigate to MySQL server directory
on windows this is: 
cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
now you can run the command below:

mysqldump -u root -p bardhub > bardhub_backup.sql

copy the resulting .sql file and paste it in music-library/bardhub. 

TO IMPORT: 

Drop the previous DB (maybe necessary idk)? 
Drag the .sql file into your query view in MySQL Workbench and run it
