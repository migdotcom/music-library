	else:
		userSearch searchbar

new structure:

Homepage should display the Featured content carousel Viet made at the top, and underneath, a big search bar. "search for artists"
to implement a general search function for all types of content would be too much right now. 
artists -> albums -> tracks
There will be an "artists" tab that's selected by default, where the searchbar is
There will also be a playlists tab and events + recordlabels tab

Playlists will just show your playlists and "add playlist"
Events + recordlabels will show all events, and in another component, show all recordlabels. 

In Artist tab, the search will return an artist with their profile image and albums with images. 

if searchedUser:
	if !selectedAlbum:
		ArtistPage
	else:
		AlbumPage
	BackButton
else:
	userSearch


I need to lay out the conditional logic inside a discrete function that gets called inside the render() function. 

i'm getting closer

i can define an onClick in an <a> tag with the link, now how to make the link send nowhere but instead change the react state? 
use a href="#" hack for now
create ViewSingleAlbumPage handler function for onClick of table entry
ViewSingleAlbumPage doesn't update the state one time before switching
